# Prediction-over-airplane-fare-for-airplane-company
•	Objective: In this project, we will be analyzing the flight fare prediction using Machine Learning dataset using essential exploratory data analysis techniques then will draw some predictions about the price of the flight based on some features such as what class it is, what is the age of the passenger, advance bookings , day of the journey etc. As we know plane fare is prone to fluctuate from time to time and this fluctuation depends on several other variable. We alse checked here how much accurate our model is working here.


•	Tools used: Python, Linear regression, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
